layout: default
title:  "Why bare minimum?"
---


A theme is used to present the data in a design. What actually matters is the content but a content gets more eyeballs if it is presented beautifully.

Bare minimum is built on the same principle. Less design and priority is given to text. Look how google cleared out its clutter with time.

Bare minimum has very minimal code. Nothing is loaded from external links(except for analytics). This helps the site load faster.

There is only one layout available which is ``default``. This makes it easy to handle the site. 

You'll know how small the code size is when you **view source**. Faster websites rank well on search engines.

Eventually, I will be adding support for categories and tags. I may add an instant search.

While using this theme, delete all the crap above.
