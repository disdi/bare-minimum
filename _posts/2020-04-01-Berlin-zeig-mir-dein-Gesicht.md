title:  "Berlin zeigt mir dein Gesicht!"
---


	past year berlin visited inside out
	visited all the land but Berlin is different


	Reistag
	very famous  glass building in which very strong government
	people sitting inside decideds fates of Refugee and thier generations to come
	
	Berlin is this your face - Berlin ist das dein wahres Gesicht ?
	THere was no reply
	
	jews museum
	Close by some low rugged grey benches
	peple roaming in between the walls
	walking admist the gravity of the greatest horrors by mankind
	it seems to hide a secret .. ti hid no blood , no bones , no ashes , no gas chambers
	What man can do when he is at his lowest
	
	Berlin is this your face - Berlin ist das dein wahres Gesicht ?
	THere was no reply
	
	
	CLub- Berghain
	They told me this is Belrin no more
	Real Berlin in in its party culture

	its blinding light , blids the very soul
	market of beauty and lust
	things eyes could see but mind could not perceive
	within smell of smoke and hash, I wispered ?
	Berlin is this your face - Berlin ist das dein wahres Gesicht ?
	THere was no reply
	
	
	Berlin Wall
	Searching for Berlin's soul , I finally stumbled at its Wall
	touching it, it took me back to its creation - 13. August 1961
	I could see family torn apart on either side--- searching for thier loived ones 
	everyoone seem to ask what politics can cost families to be divided but less they knew ..it was formation of new worlds
	some wondered if this was the price for horrors commited in the past
	but thier hopes and cries seemed to get soaked within those bricks under mortar and cement
	
	then I seem to travel thtough time to Novemeber 1991
	people tearing though the same wall to break free those cries and longings 
	each brick that broke seem to wash a tear from the past.
	
	I turned around and asked ... how could a single city ... see so much horror, cruelty , longing and then freedom and ecstasy.
	
	Berlin seemed to smile back at me.
	Perhaps I had seem its true face - sein wahres Gesicht
