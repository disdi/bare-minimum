title:  "The Last Judgement!"
---

brought up in catholic school
who took pain for us

all forgiving lord until I saw  a painting
they called it the last judgement

everything about the painting looked unreal
how could all forgiving come to punish... the indifference in those eyes
the movement of those hands , the entire body language was against everything I was told about this foreign God

it looked like the artists fantasy lost the grip of our faith...
i thought I was in a sense also offended

I came back with nice memories... months passed

THen it came
 they said gods wrath has come over to mankind.... they were deaths and helplessness and agony never felt before and that too in which representative live
 churches and galeeries I visited were filled with corpses....
 thousands died daily and all I could think of ...
 was the indiffrence in those eyes
 how could someone who died for others ...  who asked his killers to be forgotten ... today rise up to punish and kill and torment

 what have we done so wrong to cause him to cahnge his very nature....


 is it really his last judgement of mankind
